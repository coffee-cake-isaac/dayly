# Dayly

Dayly is a secure, privacy-focused to-do list app that keeps your data entirely on your device. To start, it combines a daily motivational quote with basic task management features like adding, removing, and completing tasks. Future enhancements will include intelligent GPS-based reminders, recurring tasks, and push notifications.
